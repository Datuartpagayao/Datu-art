<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> A personal blog is a blog where you can write about anything, without necessarily setting goals or trying to 
track your audience. Telling stories, sharing photos, or simply sharing your best experiences with others – that's 
what a personal blog is about.</b></p>


<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Personal Blogger is to impress other people or show to them what is your capabilities. Like Fashions this is 
my Hobbies since I'm in High School, also being a writer too.</b></p>


<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> There's a 12 Tips to make a Personal Blog</b></p>

<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Host your own blog</b>. While there’s a cost to this approach, it can help you in the event that your blog 
grows into something bigger. Understand that no matter how stable a blog hosting platform is now, it can 
disappear.A self-hosted blog (on your own URL) enables you to broaden your audience and gives you greater 
control.You own the content you create and have greater freedom to publish what you want.</p>

<p><b><p style="background-color:White;" >Anticipate and budget for technical support.</b> Regardless of what you think when you start, there’ll be 
something you want to do requiring more technical experience than you have. Therefore, create a small budget for 
this purpose.</p>



<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Brand your blog.</b> Before you tell me you’re not a company or organization, understand that if you don’t 
brand your blog that will be your brand. Determine blog formatting, color use, typefaces, media, voice and other 
elements to ensure they’re consistent.
</p>



<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Set blog category structure.</b> What major topics will your blog cover? Think in terms of the keywords your 
audience will use to search for your content. Stay away from cute titles don’t mean anything to robots.</p>



<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Plan for your blog’s future.</b> Where do you see the content on your blog leading? Think 1 year, 2 years, 3 
years out, while this may seem like the distant future, time passes quickly. This influences what you’re writing. 
Even if it’s only for one short term event such as your wedding, training for a marathon or dealing with a 
disease.</p>


<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Determine terms of use.</b> How are you going to allow others to use your blog content? Many people assume 
anything that appears on the Internet can be freely reused. (In reality, this isn’t the case.) So it’s best to 
protect yourself and make your terms of use public.</p>


<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Watch your language.</b> This isn’t restricted to four letter words but also encompasses your grammar and 
usage. It’s important because it reflects on your blog and brand.
</p>

<p><b><p style="background-color:White;">Take the mini-skirt approach to blog post length.</b> Blog posts should be long enough to cover the topic but 
short enough to stay interesting. (Here’s the research on blog post length.)</p>


<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Don’t forget the blog eye candy. Think beyond text.</b> Use photos, graphics, video, audio and presentations. 
These formats are often at the heart of personal blogs. Make sure you have permission to use photographs of people 
you know. This is particularly important when it comes to children.</p>



<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Publish consistently.</b> Remember that a blog is a media entity. Before you remind me that it’s your 
personal thoughts, it’s important to think about your readers. To this end, mind your editorial calendar. Research 
has shown that it’s best to publish two to three times a week. If you don’t do this, at least be consistent in when 
you publish.</p>


<p><b><p style="background-color:White;"> Be selective in where you share your content.</b> Don’t’ plaster your posts on every possible social media 
platform. Give thought to who’s on each platform and their interests. Consider where your topic makes sense.</p>
